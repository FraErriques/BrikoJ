Virtual Function in Java
A virtual function or virtual method in an OOP language is a function or method used to override the behavior of the function in an inherited class with the same signature to achieve the polymorphism.

When the programmers switch the technology from C++ to Java, they think about where is the virtual function in Java. In C++, the virtual function is defined using the virtual keyword, but in Java, it is achieved using different techniques. See Virtual function in C++.

Java is an object-oriented programming language; it supports OOPs features such as polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance, etc. These concepts are based on objects, classes, and member functions.

By default, all the instance methods in Java are considered as the Virtual function except final, static, and private methods as these methods can be used to achieve polymorphism.
