//<td>content : The Maxwell equations are derived in chapter 15 using the properties of two fundamental groups 
//in Physics: the Lorentz group SO(1,3) and the Poincar√© group. Although it may appear that this 
//chapter is disconnected from the rest, it actually has been placed in the right place. On one 
//hand, the Maxwell equations are connected to the most important physical groups,.and further, 
//these are closely related to the conformal group previously introduced, being a natural link 
//to justify the importance of symmetries of differential equations.
//The last chapter connects with the first in the sense that Lie groups are used to determine 
//whether a differential equation can be solved by quadratures or not. Since this is a large 
//and complicated theory, only the basic elements that show how Lie groups are used to simplify 
//the integration of differential equations are presented.
//
//This book constitutes a very comprehensive introduction to Lie theory in physics, dealing 
//with the most important features that students will encounter. The problems help not only 
//to understand the material presented, but also exhibit real physical situations where Lie 
//groups are used This book further solves some difficulties encountered by beginners in 
//other books, usually written at a more specialized level. </td>
